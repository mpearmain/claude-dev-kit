# Example: API Rate Limiting Implementation

This example demonstrates a complete workflow cycle for adding rate limiting to a FastAPI application.

## Files in This Example

### Research Phase
- **`example-research-convergence.md`** - Research document demonstrating convergence validation and MECE decomposition

### Planning Phase
- **`example-implementation-plan.md`** - Detailed implementation plan with 3 phases, success criteria, and validation checkpoints

### Implementation Phase
Code changes are not included in this example, but the workflow would produce:
- Redis connection setup
- Rate limiting middleware
- Integration with existing auth flow
- Tests and documentation

### PR Phase
- **`123_api_rate_limiting.md`** - Generated PR description with cross-references to research and plan

## How to Use This Example

1. Read the research document to see how codebase analysis is documented
2. Review the plan to understand the phase-by-phase approach
3. Examine the validation report structure
4. Use the PR description as a template

## Timeline

- Research: 20 minutes (including parallel agent execution)
- Planning: 45 minutes (interactive iteration with developer)
- Implementation: Phase 1 (30 min), Phase 2 (45 min), Phase 3 (30 min)
- Validation: 15 minutes

Total: ~3 hours from research to validated PR
